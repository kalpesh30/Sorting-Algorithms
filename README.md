# Sorting-Algorithm
This repo contains the common sorting algorithims with some sample data of different sizes is being sorted and clocked in order to compare the efficiency of different sorting Algorithims.

The sorting is done in Ascending order in order to calculate the sample timing and the array is populated usuing Random nos.

Programming Language : Python 2.7.15
Interpreter : Python Interpretor
Editor used : MS VS Code 1.29.0

Steps to Compile the program
----------------------------
    1. Open terminal.
    2. Type "python filename.py" (filename with extension)
